Tree Sitter Grammar for [Angelscript](https://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/)

## Note

This is still fairly new and as such, expect sudden and breaking changes as we figure out whether we like the structure of the resultant tree. If you figure out bugs, I.e, us parsing something we shouldn't or failing to reject something illegal, feel free to open an issue or a pull request with the fix and a test to make sure future changes won't introduce the same bug.
